There are three main reasons why using ethics in your open source development will lead you to success:
    It saves you time and costs.
    Just as developers experience software lock-in, so can you experience moral lock-in. The further you develop without ethics, 
	the harder it will be to change issues later down the line. 
    It creates a healthier work life.
    In or out of the office, ethics leads to purpose-driven work. In the office, it ensures people are being heard. 
    It simply builds a better product.
    When technically designing you don’t seek to simply prevent mishaps, you seek to design something that will improve current 
	tech, and make it stand out. Same with ethics, you don’t want to just prevent mishaps, you want to design something that will
	stand out and shine.
	
	
	
Conditions for responsibility::
--knkowledge
--freedom(control actions)
--contribution(ability to influence)


fairnes
--a lack of bias towards users for attributes that are outside of their control
+understanding the personal biases of the developer
+utilizing reprsentative data
+unpacking the algorithm
privacy
+(consent)user agency over their own personal information
+(protection)protection of user information
wellbeing
--eudaemonia: long-term prospering
--hedonic: short-term pleasure
+robust design nad development
+solving actual problems
+inspiring creativity


safegaurd > evaluation > action plan > monitoring


safegaurd is the step that happens at the beginning of that cycle, at the beginning of that ethics journey
++is the step when you are determining what you are protecting
==ethical debt: ethical decision
==ethical drift: ethical execution

Fairness Safegaurds::::
we are protecting against the biases of the developer, the biases of the dataset, and the biases of the algorithm


Privacy Safegaurds:::
-legal requirements
-user personal information
-security threats


Wellbeing Safegaurds:::
-user and stakeholders
-short-term happiness
-long-term prospering
==stakeholder mapping
==impact assessments
==fallback plans


check: for main developer's safegaurd
adapt; safegaurd to fit your specific context
feedback: to main dev on any oversight


evaluation is a shorthand for any time or points 
in time during your life sycle that you are evaluating or validating the system

Examines:::
--if system is performing to expectation
--validates that your safegaurd are working


evaluation fairness::
--how the system forms in wild
--representativness, accuracy, neutrality of yoru data
++test using a variety of fairness metrics
++compare results to original predictions


evaluation privacy:::
--consent has been freely given
--user info is protected
++qualitative: analyzing user needs
++quantative: adversarial tests



evaluation wellbeing:::
--impact (both good and bad) on userse
--respect for the diginity of fellow developers
++wellbing is primarily qualitative
++assess for unintended impact



action plans include:::
--detecting the source of the problem surfaced during evaluation
--improving the evaluation metrics

plan+fairness:::
where is the problem
--from developer, in the data, algth decisions
what needs to change::
--identify source of problem, explore options and set strategy, implement the change

action+privacy::
wheere is the problem::
--poorly designed consent, weak system security

action+wellbeing::
where is the problem::
--short-term frustration, long-term pitfalls, short vs long-term conflicts



monitoring::
--prevent ethical drift
--incorporates feedback from community


monitoring + fairness:::
--how data shapes the system, any preference for one user base over another, changes to societal undesttanding of fairness
--updating:::: identify change, create action plan, communicate to developers

monitoring + privacy::
--legal requirements, security threats, addition of data attributes

monitoring + wellbeing::
--short and long term impacts, societal expecatations
